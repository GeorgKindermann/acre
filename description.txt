Acre was written to calculates growing-space or stand-density of trees
in a forest. It can also be used to calculate weighted
Voronoi-Diagrams. This means, that the area can be spilt up to the
nearest point or to the point with the greatest influence at a certain
place. It produces result as text and visualized (pic format is
pbm, pgm ppm).

If you have a forest and know the position and size of every tree and
you want to know which part of the area belongs to each tree you can
split up the area in small parts and give this part to the tree with
the largest influence on that point.
If every tree has the same size the result will be the same as a
Voronoi or Thissen diagram, which split up an area to the point which
is the nearest to the sub-area (problem of the nearest post-office).
Usually the tree-size differs for the trees in a forest, and also the
occupied area should be larger for larger trees than for small
trees. So the decision which sub-area belongs to which tree was made by
it's distance to the sub-area and the tree-size. The influence of a tree
increases if the distance to this tree decreases and when the size of
the tree is larger than the other trees.
Instead of trees you can use other things to split up an area. For
example you can use the position of petrol stations and the size of
the petrol station increases if it's petrol price decreases. With this
information you can estimate the area which "belongs" to a petrol
station.

The program algorithm did only compare the trees in the immediate
environs, so that not every tree in a forest has to be checked if a
point belongs to it. This will increase calculation time especially on
stands with many trees.
